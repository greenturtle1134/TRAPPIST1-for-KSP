# TRAPPIST1-for-KSP: Community exoplanet patch
All files derived with minimal modifications from those found in [GregroxMun/'s TRAPPIST1-for-KSP](https://github.com/GregroxMun/TRAPPIST1-for-KSP)

This is a set of config files that prevent the SLIPPIST system from replacing the stock Kerbol system and instead move it to a star orbiting Kerbol.

## Installation

First, download [Seven Worlds Around SLIPPIST-1](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/157020-seven-worlds-around-slippist-1-v02/#comment-2980391)

Delete all config files as well as the "stockiller" folder from the SLIPPIST-1 gamedata.

Copy the contents of the exoSystem folder into the SLIPPIST-1 folder.

Load up KSP. The Space Center should still be on Kerbin, and SLIPPIST-1 will be around 4 light years away.

Do note that the distance is scaled correctly as well so it will be *very* hard to get to; I reccomend [KSP Interstellar Extended](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/155255-122-ksp-interstellar-extended-11211-12-3-2017-release/), [Near Future Technologies](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/155465-122-near-future-technologies-mar-9th-fixes-for-a-few-packs/), and/or [RoverDude's Alcubierre Drive](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/90899-12-alcubierre-warp-drive-stand-alone-v050/).
